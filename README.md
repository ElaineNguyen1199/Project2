In Order to get this code to run for gui.py you must create a new foler named: "images" and have each png photo put into the images folder and put the "images" folder under
the place you are going to download Project2 and you might need to change the path name in gui.py because it is currently set as 
Example: rock_image_path = "C:/Users/elain/Documents/Project2/images/new_rock.png"

the new project should look like this in pycharm:
Project2
  images
  main.py
  gui.py
  logic.py

The images folder should be under Project2 containg new_rock.png, new_scissors.png, new_paper.png
